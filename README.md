# Traffic-data-prediction
Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Sourabh_hegde (2).ipynb) along with a dataset (Train_df - Train_df.csv) used to demonstrate a complete workflow for data analysis and visualization.

Contents
Dataset:
The dataset includes various features related to weather and traffic conditions. Key columns include:

Holiday: Indicates if the day is a holiday.

Temperature: Recorded temperature values.

Rainfall_last_hour: Rainfall measured in the previous hour.

Snowfall_last_hour: Snowfall measured in the previous hour.

Cloud_Cover: The degree of cloud coverage.

Weather: A general description of the weather.

Weather_Desc: A more detailed description of the weather conditions.

TimeStamp: Date and time stamps for each record.

Date: The date corresponding to the record.

Traffic_Vol: Traffic volume data.

Jupyter Notebook (Sourabh_hegde (2).ipynb):
The notebook walks through several key stages:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
How to load the CSV data, handle missing values, and properly format the dataset for further analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualization of weather trends, traffic volume variations, and how different features correlate with each other using plots like line charts and scatter plots.

Feature Engineering:
Techniques to transform raw data into meaningful features, such as creating new variables and encoding categorical data.

Modeling and Analysis:
Application of statistical or machine learning models to understand the impact of weather conditions on traffic volume.

Visualization Techniques:
Extensive use of libraries like matplotlib to create clear, informative graphics that help in interpreting the data.

This project is designed as a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in practical data analysisâ€”from initial data cleaning and exploratory visualizations to feature engineering and model evaluation using real-world weather and traffic data.
